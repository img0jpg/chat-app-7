This is a basic chatting application built using socket.io based 
off of their tutorial

To use it, enter the directory this application is installed in and 
execute 'node index.js'

Then open a browser and navigate to localhost:3000 on as many windows 
as you would like and begin chatting.

Usernames are generated by the sessionID of the browser and can not 
be changed.
